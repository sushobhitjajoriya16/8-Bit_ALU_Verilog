🧮 8-Bit ALU using Verilog
An 8-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) designed and simulated using Verilog.
This ALU performs a range of arithmetic and logical operations including addition, subtraction, bitwise AND, OR, XOR, NOT, and comparison.

🚀 Features
8-bit Arithmetic & Logical operations
Supported operations:
* ADD – Addition
* SUB – Subtraction
* AND – Bitwise AND
* OR – Bitwise OR
* XOR – Bitwise XOR
* NOT – Bitwise NOT
Comparison – Equal, Greater, Less
Testbench included for verification
Verified through simulation results

⚙️ Tools Used
Verilog (HDL design)
ModelSim / Vivado / EDA Playground for simulation

🧠 Working Principle
The ALU takes two 8-bit inputs (A and B) and a selection input (sel).
Based on the control signal, it performs the selected arithmetic or logic operation.
The result is produced on the output bus (Result), with appropriate flags if required.

📊 Simulation
All operations are verified using the testbench.
The simulation confirms correct functionality for each operation.
